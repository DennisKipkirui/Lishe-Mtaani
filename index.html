               <h1>Why do we do it</h1>
               <p>With the help of research, We have noted that for the roduce to get from the farmer to the consumer, it passes a lengthy process because of the middlemen who more often than not will compromise on the quality and quantity. 
                We at Keekapu Grocers are trying to bridge that gap by eliminating and shortening the process and thus gets the consumer the best there is to offer in the market. 
                We have partnered with farmers and farms that produce quality fresh produce both for local and export markets.</p>
